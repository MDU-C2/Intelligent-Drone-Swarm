- CM = Configuration Manager
- CMP = Configuration Management Plan
- CoFFE = Combined Functional Failure Effects

### D
- DSSA = Drone Swarm Safety Assessment

### E

### F
- FANET = Flying Ad-hoc Network

- FMEA = Failure Modes and Effects Analysis
- FMU = Fault Management Unit
- FSA = Flight Safety Assessment
- FTA = Fault Tree Analysis

### G

### H
- Hot Region = Sections of a Search Area with a higher probability of finding the Subject(s)

### I
- iGRC = Intrinsic Ground Risk Class
- IL = Integrity Level (IL) is a value given based on the project's unique characteristics (complexity =  criticality =  risk =  safety =  etc.) that represents the importance of the system and software to the user. \textit(Taken from the standard IEEE 1012-2024 \cite1012-2024)
- IRDS = Intelligent Replanning Drone Swarm

### J

### K

- Rumour Mill = Method to spread messages in a Swarm
- Rumour Source = A role an Agent can have. It is also the name for the message from an agent that *(potentially)* needs to be spread through the Swarm
- Rumour Starter = A role an Agent can have. Agents become rumour starters when they pick up a Rumour Source *(message)* that needs to be spread to the rest of the Swarm through a rumour *(message)*
- Rumour Spreader = A role an Agent can have. Agents become Rumour Spreaders when they pick up rumours from a Rumour Starter and/or a Rumour Spreader
