# Issue Report
Once an issue in an artifact or a deliverable is found, go through these steps:

## Step 1
- Go to the person responsible for the artifact/deliverable
  - Is it an actual issue or just a misunderstanding?
  - If it's an actual issue, go to Step 2.

## Step 2
*Once it's confirmed to be an actual issue:* 
- Perform an impact analysis.
  - An impact analysis checks what other items the issue affects if changes are made to fix the issue.

## Step 3
*After completing the impact analysis:* 
- Bring it up during a daily/weekly meeting:
  - What is the issue,
  - What it affects, and
  - Suggestion for a solution.
- During the meeting, a consensus on a suitable solution is required from all team members. The simplicity of the solution must also be stated (used for Step 4).

## Step 4
- Create a plan for the solution.
  - This step can be skipped if the solution is simple.
    - The simplicity of the solution is decided in Step 3.

## Step 5
- Get approval for the plan from the CE

## Step 6
- Make sure there's a copy saved of the current version before editing.
- Implement the solution.
- Request a review from the QM & CE.
- The new version needs approval from both QM & CE before publishing.
