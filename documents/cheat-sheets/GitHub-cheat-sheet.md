# Add folder through GitHub web interface
1. Click Add file → Create new file
1. In the filename box, type your folder name followed by a slash /, then the file name (example: `my-folder/README.md`)
1. Add some content to the file (even a simple line like # My Folder).
1. Click Commit changes — the folder now exists in your repository.

**NOTE**: The folder appears only if it contains at least one file. Empty folders cannot exist on GitHub.

# Rename folder
- Do it through Microsoft Explorer
- Do not do it through:
  - GitHub web interface - it's very time-consuming
  - Visual Studio Code - it does not work well
