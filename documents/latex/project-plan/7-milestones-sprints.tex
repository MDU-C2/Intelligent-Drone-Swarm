\Cref{tab:milestones} describes the project's milestones.

\subsection{Network Schedule}
%Critical Path Method (CPM) / Critical Path Analysis
%Constraint for the network schedule is that only five tasks can be in parallel since the number of members in the project group is five.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{network-schedule-V1.png}
    \caption{Network schedule of activities within the project. Red arrows indicate the path of criticality. Activity TQ-02 is dependent on other activities of the same colour (green). Activity TQ-03 is dependent on other activities of the same colour (purple).}
    \label{fig:network-schedule}
\end{figure}

The critical path analysis states that this project needs at least 76 work days to complete. The number of work days available until the final report shall be submitted is 70, and the number of work days available until the date of presenting the project is 73 - this means that activities on the path of criticality must be tracked closely and any deviations must be noted and handled as soon as possible, and if possible: complete the activities in less time than what has been estimated for them.
