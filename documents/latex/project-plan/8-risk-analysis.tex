\label{section:risk}
\normalsize
%This section identifies potential events or conditions that could negatively (or sometimes positively) affect the project and describes how they will be handled.
%Key components:
%- Risk Identification: List possible risks (technical, schedule, resource, external factors).
%- Risk Assessment: Evaluate each risk for likelihood and impact. Often presented in a table.
%- Risk Mitigation / Response: How the team plans to reduce, avoid, transfer, or accept each risk.
%- Monitoring: How risks will be tracked throughout the project.
%Purpose:
%- Minimize surprises and ensure the project can stay on track.
%- Demonstrate proactive planning to stakeholders or evaluators.
%Risk identification, assessment, mitigation strategies
%Monitoring and reporting

\subsection{Monitoring \& Control}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Risks will be reviewed and identified during weekly scrums, and updates and/or additions will be made in table \ref{tab:risk-log}.
    \item High-impact and medium to high likelihood risks (R-03, R-11, R-14, R-15, R-18, R-19, R-27, and R-28) will be prioritised and closely monitored.
    \item Mitigation actions will be assigned to specific team members to ensure accountability.
    \item Any risk escalation beyond the control of the team will be reported to the project owner and the course coordinator.
    \item Team availability will be monitored regularly to prevent scheduling conflicts. Internal deadlines will be adjusted in advance if reduced working days are expected.
\end{itemize}
