\end{table}

%ARP4754A (SAE) – Guidelines for the development of civil aircraft and systems. Applied here at a conceptual level to structure the system development and safety assessment.

%SORA (JARUS) – Specific Operations Risk Assessment framework for UAV operations, guiding the identification and mitigation of risks specific to drone swarms.

%Other safety-related standards such as DO-178C (software certification for airborne systems) and IEC 61508 (functional safety) are recognised as important references in the broader aerospace and safety engineering context. However, they are not directly applied in this project, since its scope is limited to the design and validation of a simulation-based protocol rather than certifiable airborne software.
