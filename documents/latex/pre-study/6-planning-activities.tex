%project presentation and defence of findings.
%Continuous Activities
%Configuration management (CM-01) via Git for all artefacts.
%Quality assurance (QM-01) through structured peer review and audit protocols.
%Risk monitoring: updated regularly as part of safety management.
%Communication and coordination: weekly internal meetings, milestone reviews, and supervision sessions as required.
%This structured plan ensures that the project progresses in a controlled manner, with clear milestones, role accountability, and alignment with both course requirements and recognised dependability standards.
