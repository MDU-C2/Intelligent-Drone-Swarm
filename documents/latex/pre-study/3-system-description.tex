\section{System Description (Conceptual)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A swarm of drones executes \acrfull{sar} missions.
    \item Each drone can broadcast its health status.
    \item When a drone degrades, the swarm must:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reassign its mission tasks (e.g., search grid).
        \item Reallocate the degraded drone to a supportive role (e.g., communications relay).
    \end{itemize}
    \item The protocol must ensure consensus (all drones agree on the new plan).
\end{itemize}

The system under study is a UAV swarm conducting Search \& Rescue (SAR) missions.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each drone can broadcast its health status.
    \item When a drone degrades, the swarm must:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reassign its mission tasks (e.g., search area).
        \item Reallocate the degraded UAV to a supportive role (e.g., relay node).
    \end{itemize}
    \item The protocol must ensure swarm consensus so all UAVs agree on the new plan.
\end{itemize}

This conceptual description forms the baseline system (CE-02 deliverable). The enhanced target system will be detailed in the Project Plan (CE-04).
