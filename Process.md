| Rank | Phase        | Main Focus                            | Deliverables                                | Main Responsible(s)  |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1    | Planning     | Define management structure           | Project, Quality, Safety, V&V, Config Plans         | CE, QCM, SM, RM, VVM |
| 2    | Requirements | Define what system must do            | System Description, Requirements Spec/Report        | CE, RM               |
| 3    | Design       | Define how system will work           | Architecture, Design Spec, Simulation, Safety Goals | CE, VVM, SM          |
| 4    | Preparation  | Prepare tests and safety verification | Protocols, Safety Analyses                          | VVM, SM, QCM         |
| 5    | Execution    | Implement and verify                  | Log Reports, Verification/Validation Reports        | QCM, VVM             |
| 6    | Closure      | Deliver and present                   | Final Report, Presentation                          | CE, all              |

This order directly follows the systems engineering “V-model” described in both ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ARP4754A:
<ul>
    <ul>
        <li> The left side of the V → Planning, Requirements, Architecture, Design.</li>
        <li>The right side of the V → Verification, Validation, Reporting.
        <li>Simulation bridges both sides, supporting early verification and risk reduction.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
