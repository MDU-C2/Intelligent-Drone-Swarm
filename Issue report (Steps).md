<h1>Issue Report (Steps)</h1>
Once an issue is found, go through these steps.

<h2>Step 1</h2>
Confront the responsible manager about it. If it's a real issue and not a misunderstanding, continue to the next step.

<h2>Step 2</h2>
Once it's confirmed to be a real issue, perform an impact analysis. This is to check what other items it affects if changes are made to fix the issue.

<h2>Step 3</h2>
After completing the impact analysis, bring it up during the daily meeting: what the issue is, what it affects, and suggestions for a complete solution. During the meeting, a consensus from all managers is required.

<h2>Step 4</h2>
Start implementing the solution. Request a review from the QM, and after the review, approval from both the QM and CM is required.
