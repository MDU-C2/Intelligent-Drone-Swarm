<h1>Purpose and Goals</h1>
<h2>What is the purpose of the project?</h2>
Implement swarm-level coordination logic to ensure a Search and Rescue mission can continue with maximum efficiency, even when individual UAVs are compromised.

<h2>What are the goals of the project?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Modify "Drone Swarm in Search Target Scenario" so faults can be injected (e.g., one UAV has degraded health)</li>
    <li>Investigate a robust consensus mechanism to ensure all agents securely agree on a new plan</li>
    <li>Develop distributed algorithms that allow the swarm to collectively respond to a UAV's broadcasted 'degraded health' status.</li>
    <li>Design a decentralized protocol for secure and intelligent mission replanning.</li>
    <li>Design the logic for re-allocating the compromised UAV's tasks (e.g., its search area) to healthy agents.</li>
    <li>design the logic to re-task the partially failed UAV to a less critical but still useful role, such as a communications relay, thereby maximizing the utility of every UAV.</li>
    <li><i>Implement a robust consensus mechanism to ensure all agents securely agree on a new plan</i></li>
    <li>Implement a decentralized protocol for secure and intelligent mission replanning.</li>
    <li>Validate the decentralized protocol using modified "Drone Swarm in Search Target Scenario" for secure and intelligent mission replanning by quantitatively measuring the improvement in mission continuity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Are our goals S.M.A.R.T?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>S - Specific: The goal must be clearly formulated and only apply to this project.</li>
    <li>M - Measurable: It should be possible to answer YES or NO to the question of whether the goal has been achieved.</li>
    <li>A - Accepted: The goal must be anchored/rooted in both project participants and users.</li>
    <li>R - Realizable: The goal must be achievable with the resources that can be utilized.</li>
    <li>T - Timed: The goal must be achieved by a given time.</li>
</ul>
